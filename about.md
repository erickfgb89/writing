# About Me
I'm a autistic dad, husband, software developer, DevOps engineer, coffee roaster, and hopefulyl soon a casual writer!

I have too many monologs in the shower as I learn new things. I've never
had much of an outlet, so I rehash the same thoughts enough that my wife is starting to learn them.

It seems like a good idea to write this stuff down for myself. With any luck, somebody will find some use in some of it!

# About this Blog
I'll be writing about a few things here. I don't know how I'll distribute my time, but these are my goals:

- Philosophy
- Programming
- DevOps
- Coffee
- Parenthood

I live at tilde.team/~erickfgb89 and gopher://tilde.team/~erickfgb89. Get in touch any time at erickfgb89 [at] tilde.team or erick [at] aldaz.dev
